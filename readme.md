In this connect4 game that is zero-sum game, the rules are simple:

The first player drops one of their tokens into the column of their choice.This token will fall to the bottom of the column.
The next player then drops one of their tokens into the column of their choice (they can choose any column, even the one with the opponentâ€™s token in it)
The two players take turns dropping their tokens, each trying to form a line of 4 their own color.

A player needs to make sure that their opponent cannot form a line of 4 tokens in any direction, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
The game continues in this manner until a player manages to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 4 of their tokens.
  

The differences in my game are the board is 9*9 , letters represent users instead of stamps and users' moves are recorded in a text file.
